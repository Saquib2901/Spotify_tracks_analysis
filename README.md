## 🎵 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify tracks to uncover insights and trends within the music industry. The primary goal is to understand the relationships between various audio features (such as danceability, energy, and valence) and a track's popularity. By visualizing these connections, the project aims to identify the key characteristics of popular songs.

### Key Objectives:
* To perform exploratory data analysis on the Spotify tracks dataset.
* To visualize audio features and their distributions.
* To analyze the correlation between different track attributes and popularity.
* To identify trends in music genres and track durations.

## 💾 Data Source

The analysis is based on a CSV file named `spotify_tracks.csv`. This dataset contains information about various tracks, including their audio features, artists, and popularity scores.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas, numpy** — for data wrangling
* **seaborn, matplotlib** — for visualization

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` for convenience.

## 🧩 Repository Structure

* `README.md` → Project overview and summary
* `Spotify.ipynb` → Main analysis notebook
* `Spotify.pdf` → Summary of insights & visuals
* `spotify_data_description.csv` → Brief description of Raw dataset
* `spotify_tracks.csv` → Raw dataset analyzed

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository or download the files.**
2.  **Ensure you have the `spotify_tracks.csv` dataset** in the same directory as the `Spotify.ipynb` notebook.
3.  **Open the `Spotify.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.**
4.  **Run the cells sequentially** to see the data analysis and visualizations.

## 📊 Summary of Findings

* **Feature Correlation:** The analysis reveals correlations between different audio features. For instance, `energy` and `loudness` are strongly positively correlated.
* **Popularity Drivers:** The notebook explores which audio features have the most significant impact on a track's popularity.
* **Genre Analysis:** Visualizations showcase the distribution of tracks across different genres and highlight the most prevalent ones.
* **Track Duration Trends:** The project analyzes the distribution of track durations, identifying common song lengths.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Spotify dataset, offering valuable insights into what makes a song popular. The visualizations and findings can be used to understand musical trends and the characteristics of successful tracks. Further analysis could include building a predictive model to forecast a song's popularity based on its audio features.
